## Twitter for NFTs
This is a guided project that I did as I wanted to learn about blockchain. 

This is a marketplace where people can share their NFTs and others can complement those by donating crypto through a wallet. 

# How to run
1. To run the project, first navigate to the directory in your terminal
2. Run "npm install"
3. Run "npm start" to use the locally hosted version.
4. You will be needing to set up a MetaMask account with Hardhat ETH to fully access the project.

As this was just a guided project and my knowlegde is still limited I will be working on this on this some time later.
It does look cool tho.
